1) Get the pretrained model of FastText from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html

2) At the pytorch develop a model, that is a feed forward neural network that consists of three layers, an input layer of size 600, a first layer of size 300, a second layer of 80 and an output layer with two units, all layers have regularization and dropout. The activation function on all layers is ReLU
